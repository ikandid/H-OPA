# H-OPA Code

The following repo includes several MATLAB scripts used for antenna array analysis and labview initilization. It is organized into 4 sections:
	• Genetic algorithm script used to calibrate a set of voltages for the purposes of maximizing the beam power (Experimental)
	• Genetic algorithm script used to calibrate a set of phases for the purposes of maximizing the beam power (Simulation)
	• Image analysis scripts that measure and analyze a farfield pattern
	• Nonuniform array geometry design
